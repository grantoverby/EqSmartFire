EqSmartFire spams hotkeys in EverQuest. It was inspired by AutoFire, an application used by rangers in the early days 
of Everquest. It builds upon the concept of AutoFire by adding quality-of-life features. Features are similar to those 
found in gaming keyboards and mice.

EqSmartFire will spam one or more of EverQuest's default hotkeys (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,-,=).

Spamming each hotkey is toggled by ctrl + alt + hotkey.

Each hotkey is pressed at a rate a little slower than once per second.

Hotkeys are only pressed while EverQuest is the foreground window.

Hotkeys are not pressed while any modifier key (ctrl, alt, shift, windows) is held down.

Spamming is paused while typing is detected. Typing is assumed when / or r is pressed and canceled when enter is 
pressed. Typing can be canceled manually with ctrl + alt + /.

Spamming is manually paused with ctrl + alt + [ and resumed with ctrl + alt + ].

State can be reset to default (no hotkeys enabled with typing and pause off) with ctrl + alt + `.
